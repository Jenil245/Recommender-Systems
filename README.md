# How Recommendation Works

1. Popularity Based Recommendation Engine recommends content which are very popular. It depends on number of views and number of likes. Example : Top trending Youtube videos.

2. Content Based Recommendation Engine recommends content based on content type. For example If you watch action movie then you get recommended other popular action movies. 

3. Item Based Collaborative Filtering recommends content based on item similarity. For example If you buy a laptop on amazon, you get recommended Laptop Bag. Since these two items were bought together mostly. Another Example, If you watch one part of Harry Potter then you get recommended other parts since these movies are similar in nature.

4. User Based Collaborative Filtering recommends content based on user similarity. For example You watched 10 different movies and rated them. Now there is this other person Steve who watched same movies and also rated them same as you have. Then let's say this Steve watches another movie and gives it five star rating which means he likes the movie so that movie gets recommended to you no matter the content type. Since you both are similar in nature so if Steve likes it then you may like it too.

5. Matrix Factorization is really a complex method to explain. In simple words, It captures the latent features between content and users then estimates how would you react to particular content. Based on that it recommends content to you.

<b>In real world most of the companies use hybrid recommender systems.</b>
